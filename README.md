## Steps to Patch APK and Configure the Server

### 1. Patch the APK
1. Download the `tsto.apk` file from the repository and place it into the `apk_patcher` folder.
   - Ensure the file is named `tsto.apk`.
2. Use the **Windows GUI Patcher** (`windows_gui_patcher.py`) to patch the `tsto.apk`:
   - Navigate to the `apk_patcher` folder.
   - Open the terminal in this folder:
     - Hold **Shift** and **Right-Click** anywhere inside the folder, then select **"Open PowerShell window here"** (or **"Open Command Prompt here"** depending on your system).
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     python windows_gui_patcher.py
     ```
   - The graphical user interface (GUI) will open.
   - Enter the following details:
     - **Server IP:** Enter the server IP in the format: `http://[ip_here]:80`.
     - **DLC IP:** Enter the DLC IP in the format: `http://[ip_here]:80`.
   - Click on the **"Patch APK"** button to create a patched APK.
3. The patched APK will be saved in the same folder as the original `tsto.apk`.
4. Transfer the patched APK to your mobile device or BlueStacks.
5. Install the patched APK.
